#Numeric Methods SAN Lodz #2020/2021

### General Info

Project was created for Numeric Method classes on Spoleczna Akademia Nauk in Lodz.

### Index:
* Task 10_1:
    Solving equality ```3 ∗ cos(0.5x) − exp(x) + 1 = 0``` in interval ```<-3;2>``` by using
    * Simple student's method
    * Newton's method
* Task 10_2:
    * uses rectangle's and trapezoidal's methods to calculate value of definite integral:
    * ```(from 1 to 5) [1 / (2x + 3)] + 3x^2 dx```
* Task 10_3:
    * makes an array of an analytically determined approximating function ```F(x) = a *  b^x```
* Task 10_4:
    * uses Lagrange's Method to make an array of polynomial with values as in task 10_3.
